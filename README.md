# react_redux_test - EVERYPONY
Getting use to react and redux

Main ideas/element :
* React-Redux
* CssInJs - No more .css files
* layout > container > views
* Api is the "middleware", I still don't get the point of a "real middleware"
* SetState is good in a container/view in case it only touch to its state/view and has no impact on the rest of the application
* ** Fluttershy is the best pony **ever** **
